## About Me

Hello! I'm Jorge, a tech enthusiast hailing from Guarapari (ES), currently living in Serra (ES). My passion for technology started at a young age, diving into Python scripting to manipulate PDFs and other documents when I was just 14. After high school, I pursued EletrotÃ©cnica at IFES, where I was introduced to Arduino and other exciting automation tools, deepening my love for technology even more!

During my first job, I developed automation tools for office tasks, leveraging my growing skill set. Later, I had the opportunity to work at EDP, one of the leading energy transmission and distribution companies. There, I created a tool to enhance and monitor the performance of a specific department.

With these experiences under my belt, I felt ready to enter the tech industry full-time. I soon landed a role as a Junior Frontend Developer at a startup, where I gradually took on backend integrations and transitioned into fullstack development. Today, I build diverse solutions using the best tools available in the market.

I'm passionate about technology and programming, with a strong interest in hardware and electronics (I did study EletrotÃ©cnica after all! ðŸ˜„).
